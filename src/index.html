    <p>A <b>uperhero</b> (sometimes rendered <b>super-hero</b> or <b>super hero</b>) is a type of who possesses supernatural
        or <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ycbpf6n3">superhuman powers</a> and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling. A superhero
        is sometimes called a <b>superheroine</b> (also rendered
        <b>super-heroine</b> or <b>super heroine</b>), although the word superhero is commonly used for females also. since
        the 1930s.</p>

    <p>By most definitions, characters do not require actual superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed superheroes.[1][2][3]
        While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed
        with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",[4] the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary
        gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful
        or successful person".[5] Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes
        used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as superheroes but nevertheless
        share similar traits.</p>

    <p>Some superheroes use their powers to counter daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains,
        who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy.
        Some long-running superheroes such as Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, the
        Flash, Wolverine, Green Lantern, and Hulk have a rogues gallery of many villains.</p>

    <h3>Early History</h3>

    <p>The word 'superhero' dates to at least 1917.[6] Antecedents of the archetype include such folkloric heroes as Robin Hood,
        who adventured in distinctive clothing.[7] The 1903 play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its spinoffs popularized the idea
        of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity.[7] Shortly afterward, masked and costumed pulp
        fiction characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930) and comic strip heroes, such as the Phantom (1936) began
        appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including Patoruzú (1928), the comic-strip character
        Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner (1930).[8]</p>

    <p>In the 1930s, both trends came together in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes such as Japan's Ōgon Bat[9][10]
        (visualized in painted panels used by kamishibai oral storytellers in Japan since 1931), Mandrake the Magician[11][12][13]
        (1934), Superman in 1938 and Captain Marvel (1939) at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books.</p>

    <h3>Common traits</h3>
    <p>Many superhero characters display the following traits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Extraordinary powers or abilities. Superhero powers vary widely; superhuman strength, the ability to fly, enhanced senses,
            and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters like Batman, Mockingbird, the Phantom and
            the Question possess no superhuman powers but have mastered skills...
        </li>
        <li>A strong moral code, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in the service of good without expectation
            of reward. Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal weapons.</li>
        <li>A motivation, such as a sense of responsibility and guilt (e.g. Spider-Man), an altruistic calling (e.g. Wonder Woman),
            a childhood trauma or personal vendetta against criminals (e.g. Batman), or a strong belief in justice and humanitarian
            service (e.g. Superman).
        </li>
